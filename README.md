Maximum Edge Weight Clique Problem (C++) - By SÃ©bastien Demousselle, Alexandre Duplouy, Etienne Lemonnier, Guillaume Loquet, Charlotte Mougenot

In graph theory, a clique is a subset of vertices of an undirected graph such that every two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent (Wikipedia). In this project, edges have weights: a number is associated for each edge of a graph. The goal of the project is to find the clique which has the greatest weight, which is the sum of all interconnected edges of a clique.

To find the MEWC of any graph, we created four algorithms: exact, constructive, local-search, tabu-search (from slowest to fastest -- from most accurate to less accurate).

You can find the source code in [Algorithm] > Source, and find the I/O instances of each algorithm in Instances directory. A README.md file on each directory explains how to execute the code.

Furthermore, you can find the Report in the same-named directory.
